Currently the layout is broken,
but since Window 8.1 already has RenderTargetBitmap.RenderAsync() -
this library is being deprecated and will be removed from the solution.
It might be kept for posterity in case there is a need in the future to
implement it for something that RenderTargetBitmap doesn't support - e.g. video.


* Make sure all SharpDX objects get disposed after use
* Modify the overloads to render to
	* WriteableBitmap (using texture buffer to pixel buffer copy)
	* PNG file (already implemented)
	* PNG stream (already implemented)
* Add renderers
	* ImageRenderer
	* Shape renderers
		* Path
			* Stretch property support
			* Better positioning than with transform
    -------------------
	The ones below seem to be lower priority

		* Polygon
		* Polyline
	* TextBox
	* RichTextBlock
	* RichTextBox
	* DirectX interop components?
* Add support for element properties
	* Border's border (it supports various weird thickness combinations for each side)
	* Opacity
	* Clip
	* RenderTransform
	* TextBlock Inlines
